Sigma is an innovative fitness app designed to cater to a diverse range of users, offering a personalised and engaging fitness experience. Whether you are an Achiever, Socialiser, Explorer, or Competitor, FitnessFusion provides a dynamic platform that motivates users to achieve their fitness goals, connect with a community, explore new workout routines, and engage in friendly competition.

## Design Process
Our design process begins with a user-centric approach, identifying the needs and preferences of different user types. Through collaborative ideation sessions, wire framing, and prototyping, we've crafted a fitness app that seamlessly integrates gamification elements. Our goal is to provide Achievers with personalised goal-setting challenges, Socialisers with community-driven activities, Explorers with diverse and exploratory quests, and Competitors with engaging competitive challenges. 

User Stories:

As an Achiever, I want to set personalised fitness goals, so that I can track my progress and achieve a sense of accomplishment.
As a Socialiser, I want to participate in group challenges and connect with friends, so that I can enjoy a communal fitness experience.
As an Explorer, I want to discover new workout routines and explore fitness trends, so that I can keep my fitness routine exciting and varied.
As a Competitor, I want to engage in head-to-head challenges and compete on leaderboards, so that I can satisfy my competitive drive. 

## Features

Features: Rank system  
Explanation: Having a rank system similar to those in competitive games will help challenge the achievers as they will want to earn as much points as possible to reach the next rank. Ranking up also awards the players with a new rank icon that will be displayed next to their names.  

Features:  Videos
